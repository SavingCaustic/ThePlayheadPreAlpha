#make a dir for your c++ stuff

#update avail packages..
sudo apt updadate

#make sure you've got basic stuff for building c++ programs with:
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt install pkg-config 
sudo apt install git


#now get the source
git clone https://github.com/SavingCaustic/ThePlayheadPreAlpha.git
cd ThePlayheadPreAlpha
#set up build directories
mkdir build_release
mkdir build_debug
cd build_release

#test (wont work)
cmake ..
sudo apt install cmake
#install other stuff needed
sudo apt install libasound2-dev portaudio19-dev librtmidi-dev nlohmann-json3-dev

#install stuff needed for crow
sudo apt install libasio-dev

#all now set for build!
cd ~/cplus/ThePlayheadPreAlpha
cd build_release
cmake ..
make -j
# may take a while
ls -h
# you should not see a tiny exec called MyDAW2
cd ..
./build_release/MyDAW2
# if you get "illegal instruction",
# disable SIMD in CMakeLists.txt and other cpu optimizations..

# remember to always run the exec from the parent directory.
# you need to load a project so open a browser and go to
# http://localhost:18080/fe/api-ref.html
# click "load project".

# have fun with the controllers. Copy the device.json from
# assets to /user and update cc_pager and subpager to your midi keyboard.

# have fun!

## STEP DEBUGGING
# go get step debugging working in vs-code you need to change build type and prepare directory with:
cd build_debug
cmake .. --DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
make -j
