## This repository is a clone repository. Master repository is on european servers.

Ok all, I'm releasing this hoping that some of you may get it running.
It's by no means a ready-to-use app or DAW, but a first step in creating a fantastic such.
Of course, this engine could also be used in other contexts.

Thanks to the people who have put their efforts in PortAudio, RtMidi and Crow WebServer.
Thanks to the people behind Zorin OS. And well, to the whole Linux community.

Thanks Rej, for answering my questions and naturally - for Caustic. It was fun while it lasted.

Regarding bugs and issues, I will add, you may too. Fix them even better..
However, this is not the time for feature-requests regarding the final application.

Take care, make peace and stay playful.

Best regards,
