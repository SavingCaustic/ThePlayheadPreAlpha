* we need to focus a rack somehow. Else we can't redirect the midi and possibly parameter settings to the right rack.
* ok, so PlayerEngine possibly have the attribute rackFocus = N
And that means that midi messages will be read when *that* rack is being rendered, right?
Doesn't matter an awful lot, for multitibrality we *could* also read midi and call NoteOn etc before the rack is
being called. Wouldn't matter. So then each rack has its channel. Is that what we're testing?
But we probably still need rackInFocus = 0-9
and midiMultiMode = true / false


* having the render-function of playerEngine being similar to php mock
* being able to load something into a rack, like a drum machine
* being able to load an eventor into a rack, like a ocatver or anything
* being able to load an effect into a rack, like delay
* So, essentialy - we wait with timing.. 
* Maybe have an static AudioMath class, with a LUT-table of a sine.

DONE:
* Rotator
