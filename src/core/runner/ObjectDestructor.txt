/* omg.. the idea here is that any rack that wants to destroy an effect, synth etc,
set a "queuedForUnmount" the effect. (done by UI-thread). And a queue-reader (this class), 
verifies that the effect is not only queued but actually unmounted (must be done by audio-thread
 as it discovers the request), this class can do its job. Removing the unit from the heap.
